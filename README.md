Password Protection Database Overview:

The purpose behind this project is to secure hidden files in a database using python and sql. This information is then stored in a secure password protected database. It will first make a request for the password twice and from there it will lead you into the database. If you don't already have a database made the software will create one for you and ask what it is that you want to be stored. From that point on it will list all the commands such as q to quit the program, o will open a file or S to store a file. An example in using this would be to select an image and then store it into the database and then delete it from the desktop, but it wil remain in the database.

What I learned:

* Figure out how to store files in a secure way
* If files are accidentially deleted they can be easily recovered
* Ensure overall safety that files secured in this way cannot be accessed
